# PostListTask

This project displays posts list information from CoreData, which data was given from API address. Main screen has "pull to refresh" feature and every post can navigate to single post details screen. Single post details screen has full description of the selected post and image from the link. Also, user can send email, open Google map, make a call and refresh screen by pulling it down. 

Project still requires some small fixes, code cleaning, Unit tests.
